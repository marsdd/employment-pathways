# Employment Pathway Builder

Welcome to the MaRS Data Catalyst employment pathway builder repo. This pathway tool was built using D3.js. In this repo, you will find the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code used to build this tool. We use labour market information and tree structures to model and represent job adjacency and measures of job demand. 

## Getting Started

Visualisation [HERE](https://marsdd.github.io/employment-pathways/index.html). Select an occupation from the drop down menu to begin building your employment pathway. This will cause a node to appear on the page. By clicking through the nodes, you can explore various neighbouring jobs in terms of their underlying skills. 

### Methodology
This tool is meant to serve as a prototype to test the results from our initial modeling of job adjacency using job posting data. We will be publishing a post about the methodology taken to arrive at these results on marsdd.com. Once live, we will link it here.
